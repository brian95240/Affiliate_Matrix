4. The system can be deployed and scaled on K3s clusters
5. Documentation is complete and up-to-date

## Conclusion

This prioritized implementation roadmap provides a detailed plan for human developers to complete the remaining components of the Affiliate Matrix system. By following this roadmap, developers can efficiently implement the system while ensuring that dependencies are respected and critical components are prioritized.

The modular architecture allows for incremental development and delivery of value, with each phase building upon the previous one. Regular testing and monitoring throughout the implementation process will ensure that the system meets all requirements and performs as expected.
